Student Enrollment Platform

This project contains two parts: 
  -web application
  -desktop application

Web application: students can do a research about the faculties in Republic of Macedonia,
register and login if they are about to enroll to one of the listed faculties.

Once you are logged in, you can play around with the UI and enroll to one faculty of your choice.
Once you are enrolled, you need to wait for an answer from the student service ( desktop app in this case which i will upload soon).


Go to 'master' branch

Download the project and run it.

Open your browser on 'localhost:8080'

And feel free to play around :)


desktop app to be added soon
